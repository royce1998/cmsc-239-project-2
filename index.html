The purpose of this visualization is to help you learn which<br/>properties of the stocks are most important to look at when deciding<br/>to invest. In this demonstration, we will be comparing the stocks of<br/>three tech giants, using stock data from 2016.</p><h2>Visualization 1: Stock Volume</h2><p>In this first visualization, we look at stock volumes. This tells<br/>us how many share of a specific stock has been traded within a 24<br/>hour period. In a way, the volume measure tells us how committed a<br/>stock is towards the direction it's currently moving. When volume is<br/>high, something big is happening to the stock (either great or terrible)<br/>because many transctions are happening.</p><div id="vis1" align="center"></div><p>Try out the visualization! Click on a month to see a radial chart for the<br/>month that compares the volume of Facebook (light blue), Google (dark<br/>blue), and Amazon (turqoise). Note the drastic changes in dominance<br/>from month to month. When there is not much going on at a company,<br/>or in other words, when times are boring, there tends to be less activity<br/>and thus less trade volume. When the company does something exciting or<br/>something bad, there is a sudden change in people's confidence in that<br/>company and thus there is higher trade volume.</p><h2>Visualization 2: Market Capitalization</h2><p>However, trade volume alone is not enough. What if there is a really<br/>cheap stock (say $0.20 per share) but has millions of shares? Sure, it<br/>is high in volume, but it does not necessarily have more impact than<br/>companies like Amazon, which has lower volume but much higher price<br/>per share. To address this issue, we use a measure called market<br/>capitalization, which is just the market volume weighted by the price<br/>per share across time.</p><div id="vis2" align="center"></div><p>Try out this visualization! Click the different months to compare market<br/>capitalization for those months for Facebook (light blue), Google (dark<br/>blue), and Amazon (turqoise). The interpretation is similar to the first<br/>visualization, but now you see that the radial chart is more balanced.<br/>Why is that? Why does Facebook tend to appear less dominant in this<br/>visualization, as compared to the last one? This is because Facebook<br/>stocks are much cheaper than Amazon stock prices, but are higher in<br/>volume. By looking at the market capitalization, we get a more balanced<br/>and reasonable (intuitively more sensible) comparison.</p><h2>Visualization 3: Stock Price</h2><p>One of the most common factors that everyone knows to look at is the stock<br/>price. The lower the stock price is, the more shares you can buy with<br/>your money. Companies that are performing well generally see a increasing<br/>trend in their stock prices. However, there is much more that the stock<br/>price tells us.</p><div id="vis3" align="center"></div><p>Use the visualization to explore the trends for stock price for Facebook,<br/>Google, and Amazon. Use the buttons at the bottom of the page to<br/>explore! There are two details on the graphs you should be looking at.<br/>The first is how much variance there is in the stock price. This is<br/>also sometimes called the volatility. The more steeper you see the lines<br/>going up and down here, the more potentially risky it is to invest in<br/>this stock. The second thing you should look at is the price relative<br/>to the average price (indicated by the horizontal dotted line). If<br/>the price is really high compared to its average, then potentially,<br/>it can be overvalued and it may be risky to invest in. On the other<br/>hand, if the price is low compared to its historical average, it may<br/>be a great opportunity to invest!</p><h2>Visualization 4: 10 Days Return Values</h2><p>The 10-days return is a measurement of how much you will gain or lose per<br/>10 days for a stock. It can be calculated by subtracting the opening<br/>price at day 1 from the closing price at day 10 and then multiplying<br/>the result by the number of shares you own in the company. This<br/>measurement gives you a sense of the short-term profit from purchasing<br/>a stock and further develop your investment strategies. A stock would<br/>be good for short-term investment if it shows stable and predictable<br/>10-days return over a period of time.</p><div id="vis4" align="center"></div><p>Use the visualization to explore the 10-days return trend for Facebook,<br/>Google and Amazon. Click on the button at the bottom of the page to<br/>explore the trend for each company. The blue curve in the graph shows<br/>the 10-days return measured at each day over the period of 2016. the<br/>higher the 10-day return, the more you should regret no having<br/>invested 10 days before that date.</p><h2>Visualization 5: Market-Residualized Returns</h2><p>The market residualized measures a stock’s excess return over a benchmark.<br/>Here we use the S&P 500 index as the benchmark, which is the average of<br/>all the stocks inside S&P 500. The return at a particular day is<br/>measured based on the stock price across the past 10 days. This is an<br/>effective measurement because it removes the effect of the movement of<br/>the market as a whole and leaves only movements that are inherent to<br/>the specific company.</p><div id="vis5" align="center"></div><p>Try to explore the market residualized trend for Amazon, Google and<br/>Facebook by clicking the buttons at the bottom! In the visualization<br/>above, the 14 bars show each day’s market residualized over the most<br/>recent two weeks. The dashed line marks the average level. You can get<br/>a sense of the movement of the returns taking account of only the<br/>factors from the company, relative to the S&P 500 index.</p><script>!function(l){function e(e){for(var r,t,n=e[0],o=e[1],u=e[2],f=0,i=[];f<n.length;f++)t=n[f],a[t]&&i.push(a[t][0]),a[t]=0;for(r in o)Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(o,r)&&(l[r]=o[r]);for(s&&s(e);i.length;)i.shift()();return p.push.apply(p,u||[]),c()}function c(){for(var e,r=0;r<p.length;r++){for(var t=p[r],n=!0,o=1;o<t.length;o++){var u=t[o];0!==a[u]&&(n=!1)}n&&(p.splice(r--,1),e=f(f.s=t[0]))}return e}var t={},a={1:0},p=[];function f(e){if(t[e])return t[e].exports;var r=t[e]={i:e,l:!1,exports:{}};return l[e].call(r.exports,r,r.exports,f),r.l=!0,r.exports}f.m=l,f.c=t,f.d=function(e,r,t){f.o(e,r)||Object.defineProperty(e,r,{enumerable:!0,get:t})},f.r=function(e){"undefined"!=typeof Symbol&&Symbol.toStringTag&&Object.defineProperty(e,Symbol.toStringTag,{value:"Module"}),Object.defineProperty(e,"__esModule",{value:!0})},f.t=function(r,e){if(1&e&&(r=f(r)),8&e)return r;if(4&e&&"object"==typeof r&&r&&r.__esModule)return r;var t=Object.create(null);if(f.r(t),Object.defineProperty(t,"default",{enumerable:!0,value:r}),2&e&&"string"!=typeof r)for(var n in r)f.d(t,n,function(e){return r[e]}.bind(null,n));return t},f.n=function(e){var r=e&&e.__esModule?function(){return e.default}:function(){return e};return f.d(r,"a",r),r},f.o=function(e,r){return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(e,r)},f.p="/cmsc-239-project-2/";var r=window.webpackJsonp=window.webpackJsonp||[],n=r.push.bind(r);r.push=e,r=r.slice();for(var o=0;o<r.length;o++)e(r[o]);var s=n;c()}([])</script><script src="/cmsc-239-project-2/static/js/2.7f01936e.chunk.js"></script><script src="/cmsc-239-project-2/static/js/main.762d0b42.chunk.js"></script></body></html>
